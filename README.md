# README

This is an activity for practicing creating functions. It'll require you to refactor code by wrapping it with functions, adding parameters, and adding some minor error handling.

Follow the instructions in the comments. You can check your code in the spoilers branch.

## Code Notes

The spoiler code provided demonstrates the Single Reponsibility Principle (SPR) and is by not means the only way that these solutions can be reached. I've put them together this way so that you can visualize the difference between a **return** and **console.log** which is a common source of bugs for beginner JS developers.

The patterns presented also demonstrate how you can use smaller functions with one another and set default parameters (even with a function).

## Steps

1. Wrap the code in a function
2. Create parameters for variables
3. execute the function and pass the variable value into the function
