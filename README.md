This is an activity for practicing creating functions. It'll require you to refactor code by wrapping it with functions, adding parameters, and adding some minor error handling.

Follow the instructions in the comments. You can check your code in the spoilers branch.

## Steps

1. Wrap the code in a function
2. Create parameters for variables
3. execute the function and pass the variable value into the function
